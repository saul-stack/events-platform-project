        <h1>Bar-None Club</h1>
        <p>
          Bar-None Club is a lively, community-driven venue in the heart of
          Bristol, offering a little something for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're known for hosting an exciting mix of live music, comedy, and
          community events that bring people together. Whether you're into
          electronic beats, live bands, or a good laugh, we've got you covered.

        <p>
          But it's not just about entertainmentâ€” we know how important it is for
          people to grow and learn. We run hands-on workshops focussing on
          practical skills like carpentry and cooking, giving people in the
          community the chance to pick up new skills and improve their
          day-to-day lives.
